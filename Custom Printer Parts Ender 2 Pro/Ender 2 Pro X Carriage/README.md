# Readme

I made use of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and my own measurements and modifications of the SCAD code to make this modelling.
Was somewhat of an experiment of how much AI can make this process smoother and easier.

The `x_axis_carriage_printable_design` uses the original design with modified parameters to be 3D printable and usable.
The stand-offs are removed and screws should be used from behind with spacers and nuts to hold the heat-sink onto the carriage. This makes printing easier, faster, and ensures the plastic is not directly in-contact with the hot-end assembly.
